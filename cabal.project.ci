-- Sadly we can't pass `--ghc-options=-Werror` to `cabal build`
-- because it applies it to dependencies as well.
-- See: https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/3883
-- So we need this file.
--
-- This should be fixed in cabal >3.8
-- https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7973

packages:
  ./

package tztime
  ghc-options: -Werror
